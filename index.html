    <h4>Hello World</h4>
    <p>My name is Abdirahim Hussein in this moment in time i am a currently employed in the security sector i am looking to change my career and God willing and become a software engineer in the near future. I live in Birmingham and enjoy reading and chess , plus i am currently learning to become a Full Stack web developer with the curriculum from Free Code Camp and sololearn.</p>
    <p>
      A passion of mine would be football, I got interested in football as a young child around the age of 8 playing with my family after I had completed my schoolwork it was only accessible on weekends which I looked forward to it during the week. I loved football since it was a team game, and you could not do anything by yourself if you wanted to win the game the chemistry of your team had to be great and each person had to understand their role in the team, each player had his own position in which they had to control for the team to win they had to move in a unit.  My main goal when I was younger was that I wanted to become a footballer, but my parents were not as supportive with my goal they would tell me to concentrate on my education and convinced me to make my goal something that benefits society like a doctor or a lawyer instead of pursing football, I personally think it was a good idea discourage me from pursing football because only 0.012 percent make it to the premium league. Over the summer holidays, I would play freestyle cage football I came across good footballers an example of this would be academy players who used to play for a premier league team at a young age but, I soon took a turn away from that life after releasing that becoming a professional was not perceivable due to my age and ability when compared to academy players. Since I was not able to make an income from football at that current moment in time cause me to conclude that football is not a logical career path to participate however playing football is still a passion of mine during my leisure time, I watch and play football with friends and family.
